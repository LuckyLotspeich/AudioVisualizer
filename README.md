# AudioVisualizer

This is an AudioVisualizer created for the Luminary at Boise State University. There are multiple scenes to interact with and see how your audio inputs dynamically change with the VFXs. 

To Use: Have your default audio input source be the one you want to use. In future versions we plan to have way to change what we want. 

Controls:

To switch the scenes, use A and D.
Q to Quit
Escape to pull up the UI to select scenes or edit other attributes.

For the Touch Scene:

Up and Down Arrows increase and decrease the duration of the VFX
Left and Right Arrows select the VFX
